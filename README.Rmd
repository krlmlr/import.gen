# import.gen

Generate import calls.

Ever got bitten by conflicting symbols in the packages you attach via `library()`?
The [`import` package](https://github.com/smbache/import) offers a solution
by specifying exactly which symbols to load into a dedicated environment,
instead of attaching the whole package to the search path.
But what if you actually want all (or almost all) symbols from a package?

```{r}
import.gen::from(c("magrittr", "tidyr"), output = "cat")
```

By default, the generated code is copied to the clipboard
so that the developer can paste it at the appropriate place right away.

But what's the difference to `library()` then?
The autogenerated `import::from` calls will continue working even if a package
that has been imported from introduces a new conflicting symbol.
In the example above, imagine `tidyr` adds a `set_names` function.
Attaching `magrittr` and then `tidyr` will overwrite the `set_names` function,
which will probably break code that used this function.
In contrast, the import declaration remains unchanged unless we choose to
rerun the `import.gen::from` call.

The package is at a very early stage but works as advertised above.
