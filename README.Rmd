# import.gen

Generate import calls.

Ever got bitten by conflicting symbols in the packages you attach via `library()`?
The [`import` package](https://github.com/smbache/import) offers a solution
by specifying exactly which symbols to load into a dedicated environment,
instead of attaching the whole package to the search path.
But what if you actually want all (or almost all) symbols from a package?

```{r}
import.gen::from(c("magrittr", "tidyr"), output = "cat")
```

By default, the generated code is copied to the clipboard
so that the developer can paste it at the appropriate place right away.

The package is at a very early stage but works as advertised above.
